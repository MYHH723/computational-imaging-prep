🌟 What's This Project About?
This repository documents my 8-week learning journey through computational imaging. Each week focuses on practical implementation of algorithms for solving image inverse problems, with working code, visual results, and clear explanations for beginners.

Problems We Solve:
Image Denoising: Remove noise while preserving details

Super-Resolution: Make blurry images sharp and detailed

Compressive Imaging: Reconstruct images from fewer measurements

Real Applications: Medical, photography, remote sensing
